# OCR Guide: Custom OCR with Convolutional Neural Networks Using Keras

This repository contains a guide and example code on Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

I compiled this material after trying several tutorials and courses; I list the most relevant ones here:

- [Udemy: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/ocr-optical-character-recognition-in-python/)
- [PyImageSearch: Tutorials on OCR](https://pyimagesearch.com/)

This sub-folder deals with the custom OCR techniques that apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using Tensorflow/Keras.

## 1. Introduction

In this section/module, CNNs are trained with Tensorflow/Keras. The training datasets are:

- [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hojjatk/mnist-dataset)
- [Kaggle A-Z](https://iaexpert.academy/arquivos/alfabeto_A-Z.zip)

Then, the trained networks are used to recognize custom hand-written characters.

## 2. Notebooks

The notebooks are self-explanatory:
