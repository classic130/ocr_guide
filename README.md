# Guide on Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

This repository contains a guide and example code on Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

I compiled this material after trying several tutorials and courses; I list the most relevant ones here:

- [Udemy: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/ocr-optical-character-recognition-in-python/)
- [PyImageSearch: Tutorials on OCR](https://pyimagesearch.com/)

The repository is organized in theme-related folders and each of them contains (1) a guide in Markdown which explains everything (including setup & Co.) and (2) example code.

- [`01_Tesseract`](01_Tesseract)
- [`02_EasyOCR`](02_EasyOCR)
- [`03_Video`](03_Video)
- [`04_ExampleProjects`](04_ExampleProjects)
