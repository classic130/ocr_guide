# OCR Guide: EasyOCR

This repository contains a guide and example code on Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

I compiled this material after trying several tutorials and courses; I list the most relevant ones here:

- [Udemy: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/ocr-optical-character-recognition-in-python/)
- [PyImageSearch: Tutorials on OCR](https://pyimagesearch.com/)

This sub-folder deals with the package EasyOCR.
